\section{Random walks on the \texorpdfstring{$d$}{d}-dimensional integer grid}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:grid}
  \lean{Grid}
  \leanok
  The $d$-dimensional integer \textbf{grid} is $\bZ^d$.
\end{definition}

A walk on the grid $\bZ^d$ is a function
$\walk \colon \bN \to \bZ^d$, denoted $t \mapsto \walk(t)$).
We construct walks from their sequences of steps as follows:

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:walk}
  \uses{def:grid}
  \leanok
  A sequence $(u_s)_{s \in \bN}$ of steps in $\bZ^d$
  determines a \textbf{walk} $\walk \colon \bN \to \bZ^d$ by
  \begin{align}\label{eq: RW def}
    \walk(t) = \sum_{0 \le s < t} u_s .
  \end{align}
\end{definition}

A random walk is constructed from a sequence of random steps.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:random_walk}
  \uses{def:walk}
  \lean{RW}
  \leanok
  A sequence $(\xi_s)_{s \in \bN}$ of $\bZ^d$-valued
  random variables (on some a probability space)
  determines a \textbf{random walk} $\RW = \big(\RW(t)\big)_{t \in \bN}$ by
  \[ \RW(t) = \sum_{0 \le s < t} \xi_s . \]
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:RW_mble}
  \uses{def:random_walk}
  \lean{RW.measurable}
  \leanok
  The position $\RW(t)$ of a
  random walk $\RW = \big(\RW(t)\big)_{t \in \bN}$
  at any time $t \in \bN$ is a $\bZ^d$-valued random variable.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  \leanok
  We must prove that $\RW(t) \colon \Omega \to \bZ^d$ is measurable.
  Since each of the steps $\xi_s \colon \Omega \to \bZ^d$ is measurable by
  assumption and the position of the
  random walk is defined in~\eqref{eq: RW def} by summing the
  first $t$ steps, the measurability follows by induction
  on $t$ using the fact that sums of measurable $\bZ^d$-valued
  functions are measurable.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:iid_random_walk}
  \uses{def:random_walk}
  A random walk $\RW = \big(\RW(t)\big)_{t \in \bN}$ on $\bZ^d$
  said to be \textbf{time-homogeneous Markovian} if its
  steps $\big(\RW(t+1) - \RW(t)\big)_{t \in \bN}$
  are independent and identically distributed.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:simple_random_walk}
  \uses{def:iid_random_walk}
  A random walk $\RW = \big(\RW(t)\big)_{t \in \bN}$ on $\bZ^d$
  is \textbf{simple} if it is time-homogeneous Markovian and its
  steps are uniformly distributed on nearest neighbors on the grid:
  \begin{align*}
    \PR \big[ \RW(t+1) - \RW(t) = u \big] = \begin{cases}
                                              \frac{1}{2d} & \text{ if } \|u\| = 1 \\
                                              0            & \text{ otherwise.}
                                            \end{cases}
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}
